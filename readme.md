This service handles some of the (user-facing) hardware elements of the PinePhone.

It supposed to be an amalgamation of previusly written and used services.

Instead of running a bunch of very micro-services with their own configuration, etc...,
this service is intended to take over their role, mostly because they are doing
very similar things.

Note: this service is a private project. If you happen to find it, and happen to find it useful,
you are free to do whatever you wish with it, however this is only developed for myself - there is
no support at all.
